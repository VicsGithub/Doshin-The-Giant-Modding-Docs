The term “character pipeline” describes the data path between animation and model data sources (e.g., artists, motion capture sources) and the real-time rendering loop on the GameCube.

The Nintendo GAMECUBE Character Pipeline SDK contains libraries and tools to make importing models and animations easier. It was used by 3D artists who were developing games for the system.

The Character Pipeline formats are:
* ACT - hierarchical skeleton/armature/rig
* ANM - animations
* GPL (Geometry Pallete Library) - 3D models

These formats are grouped together through the same filename, and if a model has textures, a TPL file will accompany it under the same filename.

In this document, the global structure of the character pipeline file formats is outlined.
## ACT

## ANM
