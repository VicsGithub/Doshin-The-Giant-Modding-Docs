# Textures
The textures inside Doshin the Giant's filesystem are contained within <code>root/doshin/textures</code> (PAL) or <code>root/Doshin/textures</code> (JP). They are in the TPL file format. Though, this does not include model textures, as they are found in <code>root/doshin/shapes/</code> (PAL) or <code>root/Doshin/shapes/</code> (JP).

## The Texture Format
**TPL** files (**T**exture **P**alette **L**ibrary) are containers for one or more textures. TPL files originally started out as one of the formats in the Nintendo GAMECUBE Character Pipeline SDK, but was later made a standard format. Textures are encoded with the one of the TEX0 microcode formats.
