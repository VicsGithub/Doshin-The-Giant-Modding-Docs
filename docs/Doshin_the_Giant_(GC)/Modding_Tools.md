## Audacity (jackoalan's custom-fork)
A custom fork of Audacity maintained by jackoalan. It is capable of importing/exporting DSP files.

Download it [here](https://github.com/libertyernie/brawltools/releases/download/v0.78_h1/BrawlBox.v0.78.Hotfix.1.exe).

When running the app, you might get this error: "The code execution cannot proceed because MSVCP140.dll was not found. Reinstalling the program may fix this problem." To fix it, download [this ZIP](https://www.fosshub.com/Audacity-old.html?dwl=audacity-win-2.3.0.zip), extract it and copy "msvcp140.dll" and "vcruntime140.dll" to the folder where you extracted the Audacity fork.

And, if you get an error saying FFmpeg was not found while trying to export DSP file, install [this version of FFmpeg for Audacity](https://lame.buanzo.org/ffmpeg-win-2.2.2.exe).
