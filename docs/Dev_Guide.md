# Getting Started
Requirements:
* A Doshin the Giant ISO
* Dolphin

Open Dolphin and right-click on your Doshin the Giant ISO in the games list. Then right-click on Properties. Go to the Filesystem tab on the properties window, right-click on Disc - (Game ID) and then right click on Extract Entire Disc. This will prompt you to select folder where your extracted files will be located. Select the folder of your choice. The game will extract the disc's contents. You are now ready to create a mod.

# Recommended Tools
* Kyojin Studio - A map editor for Doshin the Giant by VicsGithub, the owner of this repository. Currently a WIP.
* Amuse - A MIDI and SFX sequencer, designed for compatiblity with the game's primary audio format: MusyX Audio Groups. [Download here](https://github.com/AxioDL/amuse/releases/download/v1.15/amuse-2018_09_08-win64.zip).
* BrawlBox - Use it to edit the game's textures. [Download here](https://github.com/libertyernie/brawltools/releases/download/v0.78_h1/BrawlBox.v0.78.Hotfix.1.exe).
* charPipe Blend Plugin - A Blender 3.6 plugin used for exporting models in the game's format. Currently a WIP.
* jackoalan's fork of Audacity - A fork of Audacity compatible with importing/exporting DSP files. [Download here](https://github.com/jackoalan/audacity/releases/tag/v2.3.0).<br>When running the app, you might get this error: "The code execution cannot proceed because MSVCP140.dll was not found. Reinstalling the program may fix this problem." To fix it, download [this](https://www.fosshub.com/Audacity-old.html?dwl=audacity-win-2.3.0.zip), extract the zip and copy "msvcp140.dll" and "vcruntime140.dll" to the folder where you extracted jackoalan's fork of Audacity.
