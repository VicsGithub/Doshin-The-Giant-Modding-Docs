# Getting Started
Requirements:
* A Doshin the Giant ISO
* Dolphin

Open Dolphin and right-click on your Doshin the Giant ISO in the games list. Then right-click on Properties. Go to the Filesystem tab on the properties window, right-click on Disc - (Game ID) and then right click on Extract Entire Disc. This will prompt you to select folder where your extracted files will be located. Select the folder of your choice. The game will extract the disc's contents. You are now ready to create a mod.
